            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>The universe is vast and filled with mysteries. Since the dawn of humanity, we have looked up at the stars and wondered about the <strong>origins of the cosmos</strong>. The <em>Big Bang Theory</em> suggests that the universe began as a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

            <h3>The Expansion of the Universe</h3>
            <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of our universe is its continuous expansion. This phenomenon was first observed by <u>Edwin Hubble</u> in the 1920s. His observations led to the realization that galaxies are moving away from us, indicating that the universe is <mark>expanding</mark>.</p>

            <h3>Life Beyond Earth</h3>
            <p>The question of whether we are alone in the universe has captivated scientists and philosophers for centuries. With the discovery of exoplanets in the habitable zone of distant stars, the possibility of extraterrestrial life has become more plausible. As Carl Sagan famously said, <q>"The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space."</q></p>

            <h3>Black Holes</h3>
            <p>Black holes are among the most intriguing objects in the universe. These regions of space, where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Studying black holes can provide valuable insights into the nature of <strong>space-time</strong> and the limits of our understanding of physics.</p>

            <h3>The Future of Space Exploration</h3>
            <p>As technology advances, so too does our ability to explore the cosmos. Projects like the <u>James Webb Space Telescope</u> and missions to Mars are paving the way for new discoveries. These efforts are crucial for expanding our knowledge of the universe and our place within it.</p>
